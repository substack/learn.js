<div>
In javascript, functions are <b>first class</b>.
This means that they are values and can be assigned to variables just like
numbers, strings, and booleans can.
</div>

<div>
For instance, we can define a function:
</div>

<pre>
function baz (n) { return n - 5 }
</pre>

<div>
or we can create an anonymous function inline and assign it to a variable
<span class="code">baz</span>, which has the same effect:
</div>

<pre>
var baz = function (n) { return n - 5 }
</pre>

<div>
If functions can be assigned to variables, then they can also be arguments!
A function that accepts functions as arguments is called a
<b>higher order function</b>. Let's write one!
</div>

<pre>
function hop (n, f) {
    return n + f()
}
</pre>

<div>
Our function <span class="code">hop()</span> takes a number,
<span class="code">n</span>, and a function,
<span class="code">f</span> as parameters.
It calls <span class="code">f()</span> and adds
<span class="code">n</span> to the result.
</div>

<div>
Let's test it! First we'll need a function to use as a parameter.
</div>

<pre>
function hop (n, f) {
    return n + f()
}

function g () { return 11 }
var res = hop(33, g)
console.log(res)
</pre>

<div>
<span class="code">hop()</span> uses our function <span class="code">g</span>,
which returns 11 and adds that to the 33 that we specified as
<span class="code">n</span>. 11 + 33 == 44. It works!
</div>

<div>
We can also put that definition for <span class="code">g</span> inline so we
don't need to give it a name.
</div>

<pre>
function hop (n, f) {
    return n + f()
}

var res = hop(33, function () { return 11 })
console.log(res)
</pre>

<div>
Whenever you define a function, the function is said to <b>close over</b> the
variables outside. Here's an example:
</div>

<pre>
var pressed = false;
function press () {
    if (pressed) {
        return 'boop'
    }
    else {
        pressed = true
        return 'beep'
    }
}

console.log(press())
console.log(press())
console.log(press())
console.log(press())
</pre>

<div>
Executing this function repeatedly, the first time through
<span class="code">pressed</span> is false, so
<span class="code">'beep'</span> gets returned.
For every time after that,
<span class="code">pressed</span> is true, so the return value is 'boop'.
That's just like the button from the first chapter!
</div>

<div>
If we want, we can rewrite this function so that
<span class="code">pressed</span> won't be available outside the function. 
</div>

<pre>
var press = (function () {
    var pressed = false;
    return function () {
        if (pressed) {
            return 'boop'
        }
        else {
            pressed = true
            return 'beep'
        }
    }
})()
</pre>

<div>
The <span class="code">(...)()</span> around the function calls it immediately.
Functions are special because they have their own scope, which means that
variables declared inside of function can only be accessed from inside the
function.
</div>

<div>
Since functions are just values like any other, we can
<span class="code">return</span>
a function, and this function has access to <span class="code">pressed</span>
because it is inside the outer function!
We just built a machine that stores state!
</div>

<div>
Higher-order functions are so useful, they're baked into some array methods!
</div>

<pre>
var xs = [ 3, 4, 5 ]
var res = xs.map(function (x) { return x + 100 })
console.dir(res)
</pre>

<div>
In this example, <span class="code">.map()</span>
takes a function that gets called for every element in the array.
The return value of <span class="code">.map()</span> is a new array filled with
all the return values from the function calls.
In this case, <span class="code">[ 103, 104, 105 ]</span>.
</div>

<div>
Arrays have <span class="code">.filter()</span> too, which lets you
return only certain elements from an array.
Suppose you have a list of the integers from 0 to 10 inclusive and you only want
the odd ones:
</div>

<pre>
var xs = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]
var odds = xs.filter(function (x) {
    return x % 2 === 1
})
console.dir(odds)
</pre>

<div>
The <span class="code">%</span> operator performs modulo arithmetic, which is
pretty much just the remainder value of a division operation.
Odd numbers have a remainder of <span class="code">1</span> when divided by
<span class="code">2</span>.
</div>

<div>
Suppose we want to sum the values from 1 to 10 inclusive. We can use
<span class="code">.reduce()</span> for that!
</div>

<pre>
var xs = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]
var sum = xs.reduce(function (s, x) {
    return s + x
}, 0)
console.log(sum)
</pre>

<div>
<span class="code">.reduce()</span> works by taking a function as its first
parameter and a starting value as its second.
The function's first argument is the state and the second argument is the value
of the item in the array. The return value of the function becomes the new state
value in the next iteration or the return value of
<span class="code">.reduce()</span> if there are no more elements to crawl.
</div>

<div>
When we sum up a series of numbers, the running sum is our state and we start
counting at 0. Each step, the new running sum is just the old running sum plus
the value of the item in the list!
</div>
